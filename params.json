{"name":"SwiftBoy","tagline":"This is the original GameBoy emulator that is written entirely in Swift.","body":"# SwiftBoy\r\nClassic GameBoy emulator project written entirely in Swift. \r\n \r\nThis project is currently in pre-alpha stage. \r\n\r\nAlthough most of the emulation is working there are still much more to do. My main focus is now on improving the UI for the first alpha release. Any feedback is welcomed. You can see how it looks down below:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Majki92/SwiftBoy/master/images/emulator.gif)\r\n\r\nIt still is not ready, as there are some bugs here and there, but it certainly is becoming more and more usefull.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n### What is working\r\n- Bootstrap\r\n- Fast Bootstrap (no bios file required)\r\n- 99% of CPU instructions\r\n- 100% accuracy of CPU instructions (according to Blargg test roms)\r\n- BG, Window and Sprite rendering in PPU\r\n- Interrupts\r\n- Tetris, Super Mario Land\r\n- Raw roms (no MBC) and MBC1 roms\r\n- Emulation speed synchronization\r\n- Fast OpenGL rendering\r\n- New better UI\r\n- Rom loading from popup (File -> Open Rom)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is not working\r\n- Sound\r\n- Rest of the memory bank controllers\r\n- STOP instruction\r\n- Some glitches left in PPU\r\n- V-sync\r\n- Serial\r\n- No other games were tested yet\r\n- New UI may be unstable as of right now\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nThis emulator is constantly tested using Blargg's GameBoy test roms. Current results can be seen below:\r\n\r\nGeneral CPU Instruction test:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Majki92/SwiftBoy/master/images/cpu_instr_test.png)\r\n\r\nCPU Instruction timing test:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Majki92/SwiftBoy/master/images/cpu_instr_timing_test.png)\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nAs this is my first project in Swift it may contain ugly piecies of code, but trust me, I'm working on it.\r\nMain branch should now be stable (no rebases and force pushes), all of the developement is done on the feature branches.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
