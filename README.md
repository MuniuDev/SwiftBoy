# SwiftEmu
Original GameBoy emulator project written entirely in Swift. 
 

This project is currently under developement and is not yet ready, so none of the features work.
As this is my first project in Swift it may contain ugly piecies of code, but trust me, I'm working on it.
I currentely decided to push to the master branch, to be able to easily track progress. When this project reaches usable state I will switch to feature branch scheme.
